# Development Directory Structure

This directory is used for work-in-progress content, technical experiments, and documentation.

## Directory Overview

### 📁 PendingOptimization (尚未優化)
*   **Purpose**: Stores assets, scripts, or systems that are functional but require performance tuning or code refactoring.
*   **Use Case**: A complex shader that works but consumes too much GPU, or a script that needs optimization before final integration.

### 📁 TechResearch (技術開發)
*   **Purpose**: Dedicated to technical demos, engine feature tests, and shader experiments.
*   **Use Case**: Testing a new Godot 4 feature, experimenting with a specific visual effect, or prototyping a technical system.

### 📁 GameplayPrototypes (可玩性構想)
*   **Purpose**: For testing new gameplay mechanics, fun factors, and interactions.
*   **Use Case**: Prototyping a new movement ability, a combat mechanic, or an interactive puzzle element.

### 📁 Docs (文檔)
*   **Purpose**: Contains project development logs, technical documentation, and design notes.
*   **Use Case**: Daily dev logs (`DevLog.md`), system architecture diagrams, and feature design docs.
